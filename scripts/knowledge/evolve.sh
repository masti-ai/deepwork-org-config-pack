# knowledge/evolve.sh — Periodic knowledge evolution
#
# Runs during deacon patrol (via plugin) or manually.
# Scans recently closed beads for lessons and appends to knowledge base.
#
# What it does:
# 1. Finds beads closed in the last 24h
# 2. Checks if they had multiple attempts (respawn count > 0) or incident labels
# 3. Extracts close_reason as a potential lesson
# 4. Appends non-trivial lessons to anti-patterns.md or patterns.md
#
# Requires: dolt CLI, access to Dolt on port 3307
